# Heart_disease.ipynb
We have a data which classified if patients have heart disease or not according to features in it. We will try to use this data to create a model which tries predict if a patient has this disease or not.  We will use different models  logistic regression (classification)  K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Classification Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm Naive Bayes Algorithm Decision Tree Algorithm Random Forest Classification Comparing Models Confusion Matrix  This project predicts heart diseases on the basis of different features like age, sex, blood pressure etc
